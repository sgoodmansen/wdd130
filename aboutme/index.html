        <h2>Spencer Goodmansen</h2>
        <h3>My Family</h3>
            <p>My wife and I have been married for 33 years.  During that time, we have lived in Rexburg, Seattle and currently reside in Rigby, Idaho.
            <br>We have a son and three daughters.  Out last two daughters are identical twins. The oldest three children are married and the youngest child is attending BYU-Idaho.
            <br>We also have a granddaugher that is in first grade and a grandson that is 2 years old.  In the next two weeks, we should be meeting our newest grandson.</p>
        <h3>What Keeps Me Busy</h3>
            <p>I work full-time for an I.T. department where I setup new computers and solve computer issues. This gives me an opportunity to work with different technology on a daily basis.
                Also I manage a pinewood derby business where I setup the track and run the pinewood derby. Most of the race events are in eastern Idaho but occasionally I will travel to Boise and Salt Lake City for a race.
                Now I am adding college course on a part-time basis. My major is Web Development. Over the last 10 years, I have taught myself a lot of the web design but now I am looking for some formal learning that can lead to a degree.</p>
